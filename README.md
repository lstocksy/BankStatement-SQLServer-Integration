# BankingCSV-SQLServer-Integration
WPF application to check CSV file from bank statement against database table.
Designed for a client using Microsoft SQL server to manage their members, the program checks the membership reference numbers on a Barkleys bank statement (exported as a CSV) against a database table to retreive a list of registered members who have cancelled their membership and, therefore, are not present on the statement.
